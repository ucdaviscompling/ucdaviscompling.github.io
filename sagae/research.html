	<h1>Summary</h1>

	<p>
	Much of my research has been focused on data-driven and 
	linguistically-motivated models of structure in 
        natural language. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Topics in my current and past work include: 
        Syntactic parsing, analysis of child language, incremental processing,
	interfacing shallow and deep syntactic analysis, 
	parser ensembles, discriminative structured models, 
	parsing efficiency, and descriptive adequacy of syntactic formalisms. 
	I have applied this research various areas including 
	child language development, bioinformatics
	and virtual human dialogue systems.
	</p>

	<h1>Current projects at UC Davis</h1>
	<ul>
	<li><h2>Neural models of sentence meaning and similarity for authoring of specialized content for domain-specific interactive language systems</h2>
	<h3>Funded by the Navy through a subcontract from Soartech</h3>
	We are using neural NLP approaches to leverage large 
        generic language resources (e.g. Wikipedia)
	to help authors of interactive systems (e.g. spoken dialogue systems,
	chatbots) create content for specialized domains for which no or 
	little data is available.  
	</li>
	<br>

	<li><h2>Data-driven cross-linguistic modeling of word ordering preferences</h2>
	We are investigating how various factors, such as dependecy length, 
	lexical frequency and co-occurrence, and syntactic complexity
	affect preference between different grammatical alternatives that
	express the same meaning, and what the similarities and differences
	between these preferences in different languages tell us about
	language processing and syntax.
	</li>
	<br>

	<li><h2>Empirical analysis of second language acquisition</h2>
	<h3>Funded by a UC Davis Faculty Research Grant</h3>
	In collaboration with the Department of Spanish and Portuguese,
	we are collecting a large corpus of essays authored by learners of
	Spanish as a second language at various levels, and analyzing 
	various aspects of second language learning through large amounts
	of data collected in real-time.
	</li>
	</ul>

	<h1>Recent projects at USC</h1>
	<ul>

	<li><h2>More expressive models of linguistic structure</h2>
	<h3>Funded by the U.S. Army. (2014 to 2015)</h3>
	We are investigating new parsing approaches suitable for
	joint representation of multiple levels of linguistic 
	analysis, including efficient structured prediction for
	data-driven parsing involving arbitrary directed graphs
	as output.
	</li>
	

	<li><h2>Automated Analysis of Discourse Structure</h2>
	<h3>Funded by the U.S. Army. (2013 to 2014)</h3>
	We are developing new parsing and structured prediction
	approaches for analysis of coherence relations in text, in
	the style of Rhetorical Structure Theory, and 
	investigating new evaluation frameworks for evaluation
	of discourse analysis tools. Michael Heilman (ETS) and I
	are nearing the release of a new (very fast) discourse parser with
	state-of-the-art performance.
	</li> 

	<li><h2>Neurobiology of Narrative Framing</h2>
	<h3>Funded by DARPA (Narrative Networks program).<br>
	In collaboration with USC colleagues
	in the Institute for Creative Technologies 
	(Andrew Gordon and Morteza Dehghani), 
	and in the Brain and Creativity Institute
	(Antonio Damasio,
	Hanna Damasio, Mary Helen Immordino-Yang and Jonas Kaplan).</h3>

	We are studying how people use narrative framing to
	describe events in their lives, and the psychological
	effects of different types of framing on readers. 
	For more information, visit our <a href="http://narrative.ict.usc.edu/neurobiology-of-narrative-framing.html">
	project page.</a> 
	

	<li><h2>Modeling Human Communication Dynamics</h2>
	<h3>Funded by NSF.<br>
	In collaboration with Louis-Philippe Morency</h3>

	We are building
	computational models of face to face communication,
	taking into account the omnidirectional flow of
	information conveyed asynchronously through verbal
	and non-verbal channels.  Under this project, we have
	started looking into multimodal sentiment analysis using
	YouTube videos.</li>
	

	</ul>

	<h1>Past Projects</h1>
        <ul>

	<li><h2>Joint processing for speech recognition and natural language understanding in dialogue systems</h2>
        <h3>Funded by TATRC. In collaboration with David Traum's dialogue group, of which I am a member,
        and Shri Narayanan's Signal Analysis and Interpretation Laboratory</h3>

        We are looking at several ways to achieve better integration
        and synergy between speech recognition and language
        understanding, using datasets collected from user
        sessions with ICT's virtual human dialogue systems.
        This work involves syntactic and semantic analysis and
        language modeling.
        </li>

	<li><h2>Semi-supervised discriminative language modeling</h2>
        <h3>In collaboration with Brian Roark and the JHU CLSP 2011
        summer workshop team</h3>

        During the Johns Hopkins summer workshop in 2011, we
        developed several approaches for hallucinating speech
        n-best lists, which are necessary for training discriminative
        language models.  Building on the progress we have made
        during the workshop (described in our workshop report
        and three ICASSP 2012 papers), we are continuing to pursue
        training of (application specific) discriminative
        language models from arbritrary text sources.
        </li>

	
	<li><h2>Dynamic programming for linear-time parsing</h2>
        <h3>Funded by Google. In collaboration with Liang Huang.</h3>

        The most widely used traditional
        approaches for natural language parsing use dynamic programming
        algorithms that explore the exponentially many possible
        analyses of a sentence in polynomial time.  More recent research
        on linear time parsing has produced faster, but less
        accurate alternatives.  We have merged these two threads of
        parsing research, producing a linear time left-to-right
        data-driven parsing approach that searches an exponential space,
        achieving high accuracy very efficiently.  We are exploring
        the use of this approach in dependency and constituent
        parsing and language modeling.</li>
