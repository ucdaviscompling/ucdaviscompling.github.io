  </ul>
  <p><strong>Preliminaries</strong></p>
  <p>Before we start, let's wave goodbye to TauFST, the custom web prolog we have been using for FSTs, and let's say hello to SWISH, the web prolog we will use for grammars! The prolog language doesn't have built-in support for FSTs, so we used a custom prolog for our FSTs. But prolog does have built-in support for a type of grammar called Definite Clause Grammars (DCGs), and we will use this to create Context-Free Grammars (CFGs).</p>
  <p>We don't need to worry about what exactly DCGs are. (But for those who are curious, here's a link with a brief introduction: <a class="external" href="http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pagetype=html&amp;pageid=lpn-htmlse29" target="_blank"><span>http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pagetype=html&amp;pageid=lpn-htmlse29</span><span class="screenreader-only">)</span></a>.) All we need to know is that if we have a context-free grammar rule like</p>
  <p><em>S â†’ NP VP</em></p>
  <p>(where S stands for sentence, NP stands for noun phrase, and VP stands for verb phrase), we can write the rule in a prolog file this way:</p>
  <pre>s --&gt; np, vp.</pre>
  <p>Note the period at the end, the comma between the symbols in the right-hand side, and the two dashes that form the arrow. The arrow must look like the one above, there must always be a period at the end, and there must be comma between symbols on the right-hand side.</p>
  <p>In class, we talked about the symbols in the alphabet of the language (the symbols used to make the strings), and the symbols that appear in the diagram but are not in the alphabet of the language. With CFGs, we refer to the symbols in the alphabet as <em>terminal symbols</em> (used to form strings in the language) and those other symbols as <em>non-terminal symbols</em> (used in internal structure). The rule above deals only with <em>non-terminals</em>. Rules with terminal symbols are similar, but we will use square brackets around the terminal symbols, as in the example below:</p>
  <pre>n --&gt; [dogs].</pre>
  <p>Again, from the two rules above, we can see that <em>dogs</em> is a terminal symbol (a symbol in the alphabet of the language) that can be used in strings in the language, and <em>NP</em> and <em>VP</em> are non-terminal symbols, which are not used in strings.</p>
  <p>Let's try that using SWISH, which allows us to run SWI Prolog online. Open the following page using your web browser:</p>
  <p><a href="https://swish.swi-prolog.org" target="_blank">https://swish.swi-prolog.org</a></p>
  <p>On the left side of the window, there are two buttons: Program and Notebook. Click the Program button, and you'll get a prolog editor. From here, things are similar to what we saw with TauFST. There's a place to write a program (where it says "Your prolog rules and facts go here..."), there is a place to write queries (where it says "Your query goes here..."), and right above it there's a place where the results will appear.</p>
  <p>Try typing this in the program area:</p>
  <pre>voiced(aa).<br>voiced(iy).</pre>
  <p>Then type this in the query area:</p>
  <pre>voiced(X).</pre>
  <p>To run your query, press the blue button that says "Run!" (or you can use ctrl-Enter).</p>
  <p>In the results area, you'll see X=aa. To get more results, instead of pressing Enter again as we did in TauFST, we click the "Next" button. Notice that next to the next button there are also buttons for 10, 100 and 1000. You can use those to see the next 10, 100 or 1000 answers.</p>
  <p>Now, let's try this with a CFG.</p>
  <p>Delete everything in the program area, and type this:</p>
  <pre>s --&gt; a, b.<br>a --&gt; [they].<br>b --&gt; [run].</pre>
  <p>This is a simple CFG that defines a language with just one string: they run. To check if "they run" is in the language, we use this query:</p>
  <pre>s([they, run], []).</pre>
  <p>(Here, we are considering every string that has a tree with <em>s</em> at the very top to be a string in the language, and that's where the s in the query comes from.)</p>
  <p>To see everything in the language, we can use this query:</p>
  <pre>s(X, []).</pre>
  <p>(X is just a prolog variable.)</p>
  <p>Now we are ready to write CFGs in prolog!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>PART 1: Where's duck at</strong></p>
  <p>As discussed in class, the type of diagram we used to represent syntactic structure is called a tree. A <em>treebank</em> is a collection of trees, where each tree represents a syntactic analysis for a sentence.</p>
  <p>Consider the small treebank below:</p>
  <pre></pre>
  <p><img style="max-width: 435px;" src="/files/1342779/download?download_frd=1&amp;verifier=VQ6905YyT0CwKojYHW16G8Cc0roUDN8H2o8Osd02" alt="pptreebank.png" width="435" height="456" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/api/v1/files/1342779" data-api-returntype="File"></p>
  <p>Write the smallest context-free grammar (CFG) that can be used to create the trees in this treebank, and implement it as a prolog DCG. In other words, write all of the rules necessary to create the trees above in a prolog file, following the format described above. Use lower case for the non-terminal and terminal symbols. (Again, all you need to know about DCGs for this part is that you can write the CFG rules as above.)</p>
  <p>For example, notice that both trees need the rule</p>
  <pre>s --&gt; np, vp.</pre>
  <p>So include that rule in your file (only once). &nbsp;Then add the rules that involve NPs, VPs, etc. Include each rule only once in your file. The rules that map parts-of-speech to English words (sometimes called the lexical rules) involve terminal symbols, so they will look like:</p>
  <pre>n --&gt; [dogs].</pre>
  <p>Here's a starting point for your prolog file. Notice the lines that say ":- table" in the beginning of the file. We don't need to know what these are for now, but make sure you have at least the ":- table" lines below.</p>
  <pre>:- table s/2.<br>:- table np/2.<br>:- table vp/2.<br>:- table pp/2.<br><br>% enter your rules<br><br>s --&gt; np, vp.<br><br>% enter your lexical rules<br><br>n --&gt; [dogs].</pre>
  <p>Once you have your grammar, you can try the following query:</p>
  <pre>s([the,dogs,chased,the,cats], []).</pre>
  <p>Here, the string (the sentence) is represented as a list of symbols, just like with our FSTs. After the sentence, there is an empty list. This type of query checks if the string is in the language defined by the context-free grammar. To run this query in SWI Prolog online, just type the query (or copy it from here and paste it where it says "Your query goes here...") then click the blue "Run!" button. If everything is right, you should get True, meaning that the string is in the language.</p>
  <p>Now try this query:</p>
  <pre>s([the, dogs, the, cats, chased], []).</pre>
  <p>which should be false.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>TURN IN: a file called hw4part1.pl with your grammar.</strong></p>
  <p>(To download the file, notice that there is a menu right next to where it says SWISH on the top left of the window. Click on File, and select Download. The downloaded file will be called swish.pl, and you need to rename it to hw4part1.pl.)</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Question 1: Write ten English sentences that are accepted by the grammar above and do not appear in the treebank or the previous example (in other words, the sentences cannot be&nbsp;<em>the dogs chased the cats</em>, or&nbsp;<em>the dogs in the garden chased the cats</em>, or&nbsp;<em>the dogs chased the cats in the garden</em>). Add these sentences to your PDF.</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Part 2:&nbsp;Duck at and the trees</strong></p>
  <p>Now that we have seen how to use DCGs to determine whether strings are in the language defined by a CFG, let's see how to get the corresponding parse trees. To get parse trees from prolog DCGs, we can add an argument to each non-terminal that corresponds to the tree. The arguments of the non-terminals on the left-hand side of the rules tell us what subtree is created by that rule. For example, the s rule above becomes:</p>
  <pre>s(s(X, Y)) --&gt; np(X), vp(Y).</pre>
  <p>which is the same as</p>
  <pre>s(s(Subtree1, Subtree2)) --&gt; np(Subtree1), vp(Subtree2).</pre>
  <p>Here we see that the non-terminal symbol on the left-hand side is s. The argument of s (the stuff inside the parentheses) tells us that by applying this rule we are forming a subtree with s at the root, with two children, and each of these children is a subtree that we get from the two items on the right-hand side of the rule. Subtree1 is the subtree we get from the np, and Subtree2 is the subtree we get from the vp.</p>
  <p>Modify the grammar from part 1 to produce trees by using rules with the format above.</p>
  <p>Use the template below get started with part 2. Again, notice the table statements, and make sure all of the non-terminals are listed.</p>
  <pre>:- table s/3.<br>:- table np/3.<br>:- table vp/3.<br>:- table pp/3.<br><br>% enter your rules<br><br>s(s(A, B)) --&gt; np(A), vp(B).<br><br>% enter your lexical rules<br><br>n(n(dogs)) --&gt; [dogs].</pre>
  <p>Once your grammar is complete, you can try the following query:</p>
  <pre>s(T, [the, dogs, chased, the, cats], []).</pre>
  <p>which should give you the parse tree as a value of T, and</p>
  <pre>s(T, [the, dogs, chased, the, cats, in, the, garden], []).</pre>
  <p>which should give you two different values of T, with each being a valid parse tree according to your grammar. (After getting a value of T, press Next to get the next value.)</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Question 2: (a) Which of these two values of T is one of the trees in the treebank? Paste the tree in your PDF. (b) Is there a difference in the meaning corresponding to each of the two trees? If so, what is the difference?</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>TURN IN: a file called hw4part2.pl with your grammar that computes trees.</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Part 3: The garden behind the house in the garden</strong></p>
  <p>Starting with your grammar for part 2, add additional lexical rules for the following words: barn (n) and behind (p). Use the resulting grammar to parse the following sentences:</p>
  <pre>the dogs chased the cats</pre>
  <pre>the dogs chased the cats in the garden</pre>
  <pre>the dogs chased the cats in the garden behind the barn</pre>
  <pre>the dogs chased the cats in the garden behind the barn in the garden</pre>
  <pre>the dogs chased the cats in the garden behind the barn in the garden behind the barn</pre>
  <p>Notice that the number of possible trees increases rapidly with the number of prepositional phrases (PPs). To see how many parse trees there are for a sentence, we can use just a little bit of prolog. Try this:</p>
  <pre>findall(T, s(T, [the,dogs,chased,the,cats,in,the,garden], []), L), length(L, N).</pre>
  <p>The&nbsp;findall/3 predicate gives us all of the solutions for a variable (in this case, T), and puts them in a list (in this case, L). Then, the length/2 predicate tells us the number of elements in a list. In the example above, N is the number of elements in L.</p>
  <p>Create a table (just a regular table in a Word doc or a Google doc) that shows the number of trees when we have 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 PPs in a VP (as in the example sentences above). Can you identify the sequence that relates the number of PPs and the number of trees? (It is a known, named sequence, which can easily be found by typing the numbers on google.)</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <li><strong>Your table for part 3, and the name (or a description) of the sequence that corresponds to the number of possible trees for sentences of increasing length</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Turn in your grammar for part 1 (hw4part1.pl), your grammar for part 2 (hw4part2.pl), and your report PDF (hw4.pdf).</strong></p>

  <p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>
  <p>Q: Due to specific circumstances I will not be able to finish the assignment by the due date. Can I have an extension?</p>
  <p>A: Yes, three-day extensions requested by 24h before the submission deadline will be granted.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Q: When I use my grammar, I get a message that says something like "Clauses of np/2 are not together in the source-file". Is this an error?</p>
  <p>A: That message is not an error. It is a warning that you have rules with the same left-hand side that don't appear one right after the other in your grammar. That is completely fine. If you want to stop these messages, you can just group all of your np rules, all your vp rules, etc. Alternatively, you can type this before your grammar rules:</p>
  <p>:- discontiguous np/2.</p>
  <p>(and do the same for vp, etc.)</p>
  <p>But don't worry. The bottom line is that these messages don't affect how your grammar works.&nbsp;</p></div>
