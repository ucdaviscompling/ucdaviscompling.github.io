Find an error? Please contact the maintainers! We will check it out. (See at bottom for contact information.)

Note: If you are looking for a dictionary for use with a speech recognizer, this dictionary is not the one that you are looking for. 

For that purpose, see http://svn.code.sf.net/p/cmusphinx/code/trunk/cmudict/sphinxdict or use this tool. You can also download the dict from https://github.com/Alexir/CMUdict/blob/master/cmudict-0.7b.

## About the CMU dictionary

The Carnegie Mellon University Pronouncing Dictionary is an open-source machine-readable pronunciation dictionary for North American English that contains over 134,000 words and their pronunciations. CMUdict is being actively maintained and expanded. We are open to suggestions, corrections and other input.
Its entries are particularly useful for speech recognition and synthesis, as it has mappings from words to their pronunciations in the ARPAbet phoneme set, a standard for English pronunciation. The current phoneme set contains 39 phonemes, vowels carry a lexical stress marker:

0    — No stress

1    — Primary stress

2    — Secondary stress

Bear in mind that this is a dictionary. If your word is not in it (or was misspelled) nothing will be returned. This applies to items such as numbers. This tool will try to come up with pronunciations for words not in the dictionary.

## Phoneme Set

The current phoneme set has 39 phonemes, not counting varia due to lexical stress. This phoneme (or more accurately, phone) set is based on the ARPAbet symbol set developed for speech recognition uses. You can find a description of the ARPAbet on Wikipedia, as well information on how it relates to the standard IPA symbol set.
