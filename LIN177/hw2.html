  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Part 1:&nbsp;Buy Pie</strong></p>
  <p>As we saw in HW 1, sequences of phonemes can correspond to many different sequences of words. Although this does not bother us at all as we listen to speech, the problem faced by machines is even worse than it seems, because some phonemes sound alike. Consider the following pairs:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>[p] and [b]</li>
  <li>[k] and [g]</li>
  <li>[s] and [z]</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>QUESTION 1: How does the first item in each pair above differ from the second?</strong></p>
  <p>(Hint: if you are unsure, take a look at the IPA chart: <a class="external" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/IPA_chart_2018.pdf" target="_blank"> <span>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/IPA_chart_2018.pdf</span> </a>.)</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Draw an FST that changes to and from [p] and [b], [k] and [g], and [s] and [z] in CMU pronunciation dictionary transcriptions. The input alphabet is the set of phonemes listed under phoneme set in the&nbsp;<a class="external" title="" href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict" target="_blank">CMU pronunciation dictionary page</a>&nbsp;(e.g. AA, AE, AH, ...). The output alphabet is exactly the same as the input alphabet.&nbsp;Each string in the input language should be mapped to one or more similar string(s) in the output language, except that each B can remain a B or become a P, P can remain a P or become a B, and so on with K/G and S/Z.</p>
  <p>(Hint 1: this type of FST is sometimes&nbsp;referred to as the&nbsp;<em>flower</em>&nbsp;FST!)</p>
  <p>For example, here is the entry for the word&nbsp;<em>buy</em>:</p>
  <pre>BUY &nbsp; B AY</pre>
  <p>The input&nbsp;string</p>
  <pre>B AY</pre>
  <p>corresponds to the output strings</p>
  <pre>B AY</pre>
  <p>and</p>
  <pre>P AY</pre>
  <p>where each results from a different path in the non-deterministic FST.</p>
  <p><strong>QUESTION 2:&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p><strong>a. Submit&nbsp;your FST (specified above) in a prolog file (.pl) using the prolog format used in HW 1. Name the file hw2q2.pl.&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>You can use our web app to try your FST: <a href="http://compling.ucdavis.edu/taufst/" target="_blank">http://compling.ucdavis.edu/taufst/</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>b. Add a picture of your FST diagram (specified above) to your PDF submission.</strong></p>
  <p>(Hint 2: In the prolog format, we simply list each transition as follows:</p>
  <pre>transition(State1, InputSymbol, State2, OutputSymbol).</pre>
  <p>For example, to go from state 15 to state 20, with input symbol a and output symbol x, we write:</p>
  <pre>transition(15, a, 20, x).</pre>
  <p>What does the following transition do?</p>
  <pre>transition(20, Sym, 26, Sym).</pre>
  <p>where 20 and 26 could be any pair of states. Notice that Sym is capitalized, which means it is a variable.</p>
  <p>And what about:</p>
  <pre>transition(20, Sym, 26, Sym) :- Sym \= eps.</pre>
  <p>Recall the discussion about prolog rules. This says that the transition exists if Sym is not eps (but it can be anything else!).&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You don't need to comment on this in your submission, but think about what this transition does and why. This type of transition is not strictly necessary in your solution, but will save you some time!)</p>
  <p>Consider now a similar FST, but one that allows only at most one substitution at a time. For example, with the input:</p>
  <pre>B AE G</pre>
  <p>Your FST from question 2 can produce</p>
  <pre>B AE G</pre>
  <pre>P AE G</pre>
  <pre>B AE K</pre>
  <pre>P AE K</pre>
  <p>But your new FST can only produce</p>
  <pre>B AE G</pre>
  <pre>P AE G</pre>
  <pre>B AE K</pre>
  <p>(In prolog, we will use lowercase characters, as in HW 1.)</p>
  <p>In other words, you can have zero substitutions or one substitution, but no more.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>QUESTION 3:&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p><strong>a. Submit&nbsp;your FST in a prolog file (.pl) using the prolog format used in HW 1. Name the file hw2q3.pl.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>b.&nbsp;Add a picture of your FST diagram to your PDF submission.</strong></p>
  <p>(Hint 3: this will not be a flower FST. Your machine will now have to keep track of whether a substitution has occurred. How do we encode that it is ok to have no substitutions, and it is ok to have exactly one substitution?)</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Part 2: Aspire</strong></p>
  <p>You may have noticed that the t sound is a little different in the words&nbsp;<em>top</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>stop</em>, and the p sound is also a little different in&nbsp;<em>pit</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>spit</em>. This is because of aspiration. In top and pit, there is a stronger burst of breath that comes out with the first consonant sound.</p>
  <p>A (simplistic) phonological rule for aspiration in English goes as follows:</p>
  <p>Voiceless plosives are aspirated when they occur immediately before a stressed vowel, and there is no [s] immediately preceding the voiceless plosive.</p>
  <p>For example, in pot [p<sup>h</sup>ɑt] we get aspiration, but not in spot [spɑt].</p>
  <p>Let's now consider&nbsp;a version of the CMU pronunciation dictionary that has stress marked in the transcriptions. For example, the word potato looks like</p>
  <pre>P AH T EY1 T OW</pre>
  <p>where the 1 appended to EY means that the vowel is stressed. Every vowel can be unstressed, e.g. AA, EY, OW, or stressed, e.g. AA1, EY1, OW1 (this is a slight simplification of how stress is represented in the standard CMU pronunciation dictionary.)</p>
  <p>Create an FST that adds aspiration to transcriptions according to the rule above. The input alphabet is the set of symbols in the ARPABET plus the stressed vowels ending in 1. The output alphabet is the same, plus additional symbols as follows: each symbol that corresponds to a voiceless plosive gets a duplicate with _h appended to it. For example, the symbol T is in the output alphabet, and in addition, we also have the new symbol T_h in the output alphabet.</p>
  <p>Step 1: Find the CMU dictionary ARPABET symbols that correspond to voiceless plosives (consult the IPA chart if necessary).&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Step 2: Consider now the expanded output alphabet based on step 1.</p>
  <p>Step 3: Create a transducer that implements the phonological rule above and produces output with the new symbols that reflect aspiration when appropriate. The input is the transcription as produced by a transducer like cmudict.pl from HW 1, but with the additional symbols to denote stress (e.g. ay1, ow1, ey1), as shown above. The output should be the transcription with aspiration.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To create the transducer in prolog format, we make all of the symbols lowercase. For example, if our input is</p>
  <pre>[p, ah, t, ey1, t, ow]</pre>
  <p>the output should be</p>
  <pre>[p, ah, t_h, ey1, t, ow]</pre>
  <p>where the t_h is the aspirated allophone of t.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Notice that the first t is aspirated, but the p and second t are not.</p>
  <p>(It is fine if your transducer maps the input string to itself, in addition to the aspirated version. However, it is not fine if your transducer creates aspirated plosives where it is not appropriate according to the rule above.)</p>
  <p><strong>QUESTION 4:</strong></p>
  <p><strong>a. Submit&nbsp;your FST as a file in prolog format. Call it&nbsp;hw2q4.pl.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>b.&nbsp;Add a picture of your FST diagram to your PDF submission.</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>FAQ&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p><strong>These questions will be updated as more students ask questions. Please check back often.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Q: Can I have an extension?</strong></p>
  <p>A: Yes! Just send me a message on canvas requesting an extension 24h before the deadline, and you can have a three-day extension.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Q: Does the alphabet need to be specified in the prolog version of the machine? What about in the diagram?</strong></p>
  <p>A: No, since the alphabets are given for each machine, you don't need to worry about symbols that are not in the given alphabets. If you use a variable to create transitions for multiple symbols, it's not necessary to rule out symbols that are not in the alphabet. In the diagram, you can also assume the alphabets are the ones given in the description of the assignment, and you don't need to repeat them in your diagram. (If you use any sets that are not the alphabets, you do need to specify those explicitly.)</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Q: When I tried my FST in prolog, I see "limit exceeded". What does that mean?</strong></p>
  <p>A: Some queries would require prolog to go on for too long (often infinitely long), so there is a hard limit on how much computation prolog is allowed to do for each query. That message means that limit was exceeded. (Think about what could cause a machine to go on forever, even when dealing with a finite input string.)</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Q: Does the machine that changes P to B, etc. need to work for any input strings made of arpabet symbols, or just the examples provided? How can I make it work for any strings, and strings of any length?</strong></p>
  <p>A: Yes, these machines need to work with arbitrary strings. We could have input strings like BBB (when we do this in prolog, we'll represent this string as [b, b, b]). If we have the input string BBB, and we have a machine that can keep each B or replace it with P, the output strings would be BBB, BBP, BPB, BPP, PBB, PBP, PPB and PPP. With the machine that can replace symbols at most once, the output strings would be BBB, BBP, BPB and PBB. Also, the strings don't need to be three symbols long, and they don't need to start with P, B, K, G, S or Z. We could have an input string like<br>EH R P L EY N<br>(that's the pronunciation of airplane)<br>and the output strings would be<br>EH R P L EY N<br>and<br>EH R B L EY N</p>
  <p>So the question is how to create a machine that can take input of any length, replace P with B, B with P, etc., and keep everything else the same. To replace P with B, you know that we will need a transition that has this pair of input symbol and output symbol P:B, and for the other replacements we will need B:P, K:G, etc. But what does the machine look like?</p>
  <p>To get the shape of the machine right, we can set aside the replacements for now, and just create a machine that gets an input string, and produces an output string that is identical to the input string. The input alphabet is the arpabet, and the input language is Sigma star, meaning any string that can be made with symbols from the arpabet. To create this machine, let's first think about how we would create an acceptor (an FSA) for the input language. If you can create a machine that accepts any input string made of symbols from the arpabet, the transducer that outputs the same string as the output string is exactly the same. (Hint: you only need one state to create the Sigma star machine!)</p>
  <p>If you have the machine that gets an input string and outputs an identical string, now you just need to add more transitions to take care of the substitutions (B to P, B to P, K to G, etc.).</p>
  <p>For the next machine, the one that allows at most one substitution, you are going to use some of the same ideas, but you can use states to keep track of what happened so far (see the aaabbb example at the end of lecture 10). The trick here is to have a state where no substitutions have occurred, and a separate state where one substitution has occurred.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Q: How can I make prolog remember a value, or look ahead in the string, etc.? I know how to write the program in another language, but not in prolog. How do I write the prolog program?</strong></p>
  <p>The problem might be that you are thinking about this in terms of how you would do it with imperative programming. The idea here is to design the FST, not how to write an imperative program, and not not how to write a prolog program. Don't think about prolog, and try not to think about storing things in variables, etc. In an FST, we don't have variables or lists, we just have the states and the transitions.</p>
  <p>If you can design your FST, you can then just convert it into the list of transitions, initial state and final states. There is nothing else in prolog you really need. As we discussed in class (and in the hint), you can use variables to save some typing, but even that is not really necessary to make it work.</p>
  <p>My suggestion is to think about what paths you would need in your FST. Basically, the idea is that it in the end, what matters to the FST is whether you are at a final state at the end of the input string. You can have whatever paths you want, but you only get an input string mapped to an output string if you are at a final state when you reach the end of the input string. For example, let's say it you want to change a to x whenever it's followed by a 9, like in these input output pairs:</p>
  <p>abcabc -&gt; abcabc<br>abca9c -&gt; abcx9c</p>
  <p>We are definitely going to need a transition with a:x. That should lead to some state, let's call it state q2. From q2, you need a transition. But what is the input symbol in that transition? Well, we just changed a to x, so now we must get a 9. We have to, because that's the rule. So there is a transition out of q2 with 9:9 (which we just write as 9). But what if the input string is abcabc? Would we change the a to x, then wait for a 9? No, that path just doesn't lead to a final state, so that path doesn't matter if the string is abcabc. We just have to accept the string with a different path.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Q: How do I do X in prolog (where X is string concatenation, variable assignment, or anything else we didn't talk about in class)?</strong></p>
  <p>A: Don't do it. I can tell you how to do it in prolog, but don't do it in the assignment. Remember, you are not writing a prolog program. You need to design the right FST. Once the FST is right, just convert it to the notation we use in prolog. For that, all you need was already discussed in class. If you have a question about how to convert a specific part of your FST, feel free to ask about that.</p></div>
